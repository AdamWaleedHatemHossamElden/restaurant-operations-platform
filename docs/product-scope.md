# Product scope

## Product problem

Restaurant teams often coordinate reservations, table service, kitchen work, stock, staffing, and payments through disconnected tools or informal hand-offs. The Restaurant Operations Platform is intended to provide one coherent operational system while retaining clear module boundaries.

## Intended users

- Restaurant administrators and managers
- Hosts and reservation staff
- Waiters and cashiers
- Kitchen staff
- Inventory managers and purchasing staff
- Employees who need schedules and shift information

## Planned workflows

The product roadmap covers identity and role assignment; employee and shift coordination; table and reservation management; menu publishing; order capture and kitchen progression; inventory consumption and purchasing; payment recording; operational reporting; notifications; and traceable auditing.

## Planned modules

The modular monolith is planned around `auth`, `users`, `employees`, `tables`, `reservations`, `menu`, `orders`, `kitchen`, `inventory`, `suppliers`, `payments`, `reports`, `notifications`, and `audit`. A module will be added only when its phase is implemented; Phase 1 does not create empty classes for these future areas.

## Phase 1 boundaries

Phase 1 includes project structure, runtime configuration, a health API, restricted security defaults, migration infrastructure, five foundation tables, local MySQL orchestration, frontend connection status, tests, and planning documentation.

Authentication, user administration, restaurant CRUD, reservations, orders, kitchen screens, inventory, schedules, payments, reporting, production deployment, and real-time business events are explicitly out of scope.
